Thanuz Demo

#### Change In Approach

There are four areas of work
@ul

- students plan from advisor drafts
- content admin in CAT

We do number 1 to done, then 2, and so on.  No ocean-boiling.

#### This means

Instead of building skyscraper left-to-right, we build bottom to top.

We want to cut things off ASAP.  MVP.

---

#### Timelines

Want to timebox efforts.  2-3 weeks for each piece.  We can push out if we choose to, but we want to put things to bed and move on.

#### Why share this?

[Ben's view in pages docs](https://student-platform.pages.devops.eab.com/backend/features/leanap_index.html).

Track things in Jira.
